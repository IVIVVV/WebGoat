In here i will focus mainly on how http response splitting works and how it can be used to carry out some other technique

1. First lets talk about what this is.
- So http is a protocol used to help clients and server interact with each other. The clients send a request and the server will response with a result, 
this result normaly would be known from the server or else the server would response with the 404 code. Since there is a chain between the client and 
server, hackers will always find a way to make use of it
- http response splitting is when the client send 1 request, along with more than 1 responses set by the client to the server in which one of the request 
is a legit request while others are malicious.

2. So how does it work?
- Let's say when sending 1 request with 2 repsonse to the server, the first requset is a legit one and lead to some branches of the server and the second
one contains some malicious content.
- But if this second response doesnt have any request to map to it would just be hanging there.
